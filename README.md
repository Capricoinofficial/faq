## **Capricoin+ Upgrade**

**Capricoin+** is an incompatible upgrade with the old and deprecated [Capricoin](https://github.com/Capricoinofficial/Capricoin), The capricoin team opted for a coin swap instead of wasting huge resources on the old coin to avoid having to do multiple network hard forks to activate the newer source code with all the features that Capricoin+ is shipping with.

**This is what everyone needs to know:**

 - Capricoin+ is not a hard fork, it is a comletely different protocol meant to replace the old Capricoin 
 - Every Capricoin user is entitled to a 1:1 swap 
 - Capricoin+'s ticker is CPS instead of CPC
 - Capricoin+ is a PoS coin using an improved version of PoSV3 protocol and is based on Bitcoin 0.18.1
 - Capricoin+'s RPC/API is completely compatible with Bitcoin 0.18.1 RPC/API
